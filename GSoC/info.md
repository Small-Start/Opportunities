# Google Summer of Code 

This is a simple guide for Google Summer Of Code. 


## What is GSoC

Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual global program sponsored and managed by Google. The program focuses on bringing more student developers into open source project development. In this program, the students work with an Open source organization under the guidance of mentors (selected organization members) on a 3-month programming project in Summers. In this program, Google also awards stipends to students in 3 rounds or evaluations. The amount of Stipend depends on students geographical location.

The whole program is divided into 3 evaluations or coding stages. Students plan & code for 1st month and then mentors review their work and provide their evaluation feedback and status to Google. The evaluation feedback and status(Passed/Failed) is then provided to the student on her dashboard. The students also submit the evaluation of their mentor, but those are just a few questions related to the project and mentor’s performance. This whole process happens 3 times, and then the results are announced by Google.
    
   ### Why GSoC?
   
There are various benefits of completing GSoC.

1. The recognition: GSoC is recognized worldwide, so when applying for jobs you’ll get an advantage. However, GSoC students are more preferred by Startups than well-established organizations because, in startups like GSoC, you have to learn new skills and technologies very fast and become good at it.

2. The network: After completing GSoC you now have many connections which help you and can provide recommendation when needed.

3. The Stipend: They pay well.

4. The referral: After completing the program you are given a one-time referral which you can use within 6 years for any job at Google.

5. The Exposure: When working on the project with experienced developers, you get to learn a lot and get the industry’s exposure.

6. The Swag: What do developers like more than swag or goodies. You’ll get a GSoC T-shirt and a certificate.

7. Chance to Mentor: You can also be a mentor the next time or in GCI by Google.
