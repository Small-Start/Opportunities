# Google Summer of Code 

This is a simple guide for Google Summer Of Code. 


## What is GSoC

A chance to work with an open source organization for 3 months. Its a global program that is organized by Google every year.
    
1. Why GSoC?
	Its not a competition, it's a collaboration where you actually learn to write practical code. 
	Your code will get reviewed by the **best mentors** from the world. Finally, you will be  having a great project to talk about in your *placement interviews*. Apart from all of this, you will definetely get money and some bragging rights :p
